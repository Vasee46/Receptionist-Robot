# Receptionist-Robot
I created a Receptionist Robot which can move along the Predefined paths and Also i used algorithms like Dead Reckoning, PID for Precise Movements 
the robot has a home position , i added three destinations where the commands can be given from the Arduino controller Application via Bluetooth.
#Robot Distance measurement:
 i used IR sensor as wheel encoder.
 4 strips for 1 wheel rotation with this the distance of the robot can be measured 
#Position and orientation:
 By fusing the readings of the IR sensor and Gyroscope sensor to attain the Robot's position and orientation.
 with that i used Dead reckoning and PID Method to precise movements and turnings
